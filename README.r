id Software's Quake2 3.21+Changes by Steven Fuller <relnev@icculus.org>, 
                                     et al.


For this to be of any use, you _must_ own a copy of Quake 2.  The demo would
also work, but you might as well buy the full thing now.

These modifications are intended for Linux users, as I do not have have
access to other platforms.

Be sure to install SDL 1.2 (http://www.libsdl.org) if you want to use the
softsdl or sdlgl drivers, or the sdlquake2 binary.

'make' will, by default, build both the debug and release files.
To build fully optimized binaries: make build_release
The resulting binaries are then put in releasei386.


Makefile options:
-----------------
(quake2 and gamei386.so are always built, but the following options can be
 changed by editing the Makefile)
BUILD_SDLQUAKE2		Build sdlquake2, a quake2 binary that uses SDL for
                        CD audio and sound access (default = YES).
BUILD_SVGA              Build ref_soft.so, a quake2 video driver that uses
                        SVGAlib (default = NO).
BUILD_X11               Build ref_softx.so, a quake2 video driver that uses
                        X11 (default = YES).
BUILD_GLX               Build ref_glx.so, a quake2 video driver that uses
                        X11's GLX (default = YES).
BUILD_FXGL              Build ref_gl.so [might be renamed to fxgl later], 
                        a quake2 video driver that uses fxMesa (default =
                        NO).  This option is currently untested because I do 
                        not have a Voodoo 1 or 2.
BUILD_SDL               Build ref_softsdl.so, a quake2 video driver that
                        uses SDL (default = YES).
BUILD_SDLGL             Build ref_sdlgl.so, a quake2 video driver that uses
                        OpenGL with SDL (default = YES).
BUILD_CTFDLL            Build the Threewave CTF gamei386.so (default = NO).


To install the Quake2 gamedata:
-------------------------------
(installdir is wherever you want to install quake2, and cdromdir is wherever
you mount the Quake 2 CD-ROM)
1. copy <cdromdir>/Install/Data/baseq2/pak0.pak to <installdir>/baseq2/
2. copy <cdromdir>/Install/Data/baseq2/videos/ to <installdir>/baseq2/
   (optional)
3. Download q2-3.20-x86-full.exe from
   ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/ or a mirror site, and extract the 
   contents to a temporary directory (use unzip -L, as this is a standard zip
   file).
4. copy <q2-3.20-x86-full.exe temp directory>/baseq2/pak1.pak to
   <installdir>/baseq2/
5. copy <q2-3.20-x86-full.exe temp directory>/baseq2/pak2.pak to
   <installdir>/baseq2/
6. copy <q2-3.20-x86-full.exe temp directory>/baseq2/players/ to 
   <installdir>/baseq2/

To install this program:
------------------------
(builddir is either debugi386 or releasei386)
1. copy <builddir>/gamei386.so to <installdir>/baseq2/
2. copy <builddir>/ref_*.so to <installdir>
3. copy <builddir>/quake2 to <installdir>
4. copy <builddir>/sdlquake2 to <installdir> (optional)


To run:
-------
cd <installdir> && ./quake2
Or:
quake2 +set basedir <installdir>

/etc/quake2.conf is no longer needed; instead, the ref_*.so files are loaded
from basedir (basedir is "." by default, and can only be set at the command
line).

Configuration files and such are saved in ~/.quake2/, so <installdir> can be
made read-only or whatever.

WARNING: Please do not make quake2 or any of the libraries suid root!  Doing
so is at your own risk.

NOTE: Save games will not work across different versions or builds, because
of the way they are stored.

Dedicated Server:
-----------------
If there is a demand for it, I can add support for an explicit q2ded binary.
Else, using +set dedicated 1 should be fine.

Joystick Support:
-----------------
None yet.

Commonly used commands:
-----------------------
cd_nocd 0               // disable CD audio
s_initsound 0           // disable sound
_windowed_mouse 0       // disable mouse-grabbing
gl_ext_multitexture 0   // disable OpenGL Multitexturing (requires a
                           vid_restart)
vid_ref <driver>        // select a video driver (softx is the original
                           X11-only, softsdl is SDL software, sdlgl is 
                           SDL OpenGL)
vid_fullscreen 0        // disable fullscreen mode
vid_restart             // restart video driver
snd_restart             // restart sound driver
basedir <dir>           // point quake2 to where the data is
gl_driver <libGL.so>    // point quake2 to your libGL
dedicated 1             // run quake2 as a dedicated server

When using these commands on the quake2 command line, use +set to cause the
variables be set before the config files are loaded (important for
gl_driver). e.g.
./quake2 +set vid_ref glx +set gl_driver /usr/lib/libGL.so.1

If quake2 crashes when trying to load an OpenGL based driver (glx, sdlgl),
make sure its not loading the wrong libGL.

Is lighting slow in OpenGL (while firing, explosions, etc.)? Disable
multitexturing (gl_ext_multitexture 0; vid_restart).
